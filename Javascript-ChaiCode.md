## 2] Setting up local environment in local machine for Javascript
<br>

> [!NOTE]
> - Make folder & open folder in VS Code -> make file test.js 
> - Drag & Drop folder in VS Code.
> - text file -> .txt
> - js file -> .js

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Q. You can not think how to excute .js file ? Question you have think like how types of question think in brain?
> Q. - What difference in write .js file not write .txt file?
> Q. - Which S/W can execute it? How to write code?
<br>


### `.txt` & `.js`
- No most one difference in these 2 files .txt & .js
- But in `.js` file texts are not random ( in that file special meaning with syntax)
- E.g.
``` Js
   console.log("Swapnil")
```

- .txt file & .js files difference is - which file can injection in S/W & execute it.
- S/W like compiler, Interpreter...

> [!NOTE]
> - All over S/W's has own Syntax Structure Capability. 
> - When we write on console -> its allready define. i.e. .js, .py,..

#### Q. After except looking of main, console what next?..
- from console syntax, give we any input or process any data & what can you show in output?
- All above work done in S/W you called `Compiler` OR sometime called `Interpreter`.
<br>

### Javascript & S/W
- Few years ago, S/W are only available for browser.
- Also that time S/W are not easily available becz, they have most no. of process for configure it, setup are required long process.
- S/W is a attached with only in browser (firefox or chrome) steps in browser are write index.html & script because S/W are attached with browser only. 
- Recent days, S/W move from browser to `standalone execution`.
- After standalone execution working -
  - Javascript is not only for Browser language OR Frontend language.
  - It also used in Backend, Mobile or used in everywhere etc...
<br>

### Setup JS Environment
- Node JS Environment -> `S/W for execute Javascript`
- Environment useful -
  - Without making in a browser index file
  - Without inspect mode console 
<br>

> [!NOTE] 
> - `Node JS` & `Deno Js` are S/W or library have same & also same founder -> Ryan Dahl (Main lead founder)
> - For `Production grade environment` -> Choose LTS
> - Code Writing Tool - VS Code (Code Editor)
<br>

### JS file Execution
- Open terminal -
  - -> `node -v`  (check for version)
  - -> `node test.js` (then execute it)
<br>

Other simple way of execution for making portfolio in browser work are in next.
